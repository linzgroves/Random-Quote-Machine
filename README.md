# Random-Quote-Machine
This utilizes HTML+CSS+JavaScript to display a random quote when a button is clicked.

Things to still do:
  1. DONE! Make sure that when the page first loads, there is already a quote that fills out the div below the button.
  2. Figure out how to rework the array (possibly using objects?) so that the quote and author are separate values and therefore, can be styled independently of one another. Or see if there is a way to do this utilizing how the array is currently setup.
  3. PARTIAL: Have a Tweet button that only provides the option to tweet the page and not the quote.
  Set up the option to tweet the quote displayed on the page. Check out this link for help with that:   http://zoerooney.com/blog/tutorials/code-tweet-text-link/
  4. Add more quotes!
